    "# Optimal bidding on the first round of Wizard\n",
    "Nick Holden\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Wizard is a trick taking card game, played with a normal 52 card deck with the addition of four \"Jester\" cards, and four \"Wizard\" cards. Wizard forces players to make judgement calls with imperfect information on how many tricks they can take, and tests the players' abilities to successfully make their bids. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Gameplay\n",
    "At the start of each round, all players are dealt a varying number of cards (some number between 1 - $\\frac{59}{n}$ cards) and one more card from the deck is flipped face up to determine a trump suit. The trump suit is the suit of the upturned card, if a Wizard is flipped over the trump suit is the dealers choice and if a Jester is flipped over there is no trump suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once players are dealt their hands and a trump suit is determined, the dealer then starts off the bidding phase by looking at his hand and publicly announce how many tricks they believe they can take. The bidding then moves left and ends with the player to the right of the dealer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once every player has bid the dealer starts off the play by leading a card from their hand. Players must follow suit if they can, but they have the option to play a Wizard or a Jester at any time. Once every player has played one card,  the \"trick\" is assigned by the following heirachy: \n",
    "* To the player who played the first Wizard\n",
    "* If no Wizards were played, the player who played the highest card in the trump suit (A > K ... > 2) \n",
    "* If no Wizards or trump, the player who played the highest card in the led suit\n",
    "* If only Jesters were played, then the trick is assigned to the player who played the first Jester. \n",
    "\n",
    "The player who took the most recent trick obtains the lead for the next trick. Once all of the cards have been played, players are scored for the round based on how close they were to their bid. \n",
    "* If the player bid correctly, they are awarded 20 points plus 10 points for each trick they took. For example if a player bid 3 and made 3, they would be awarded $20 + 3 * 10 = 50$ points\n",
    "* If the player bid incorrectly, they lose 10 points for each card they are off by. If a player bid 3 and made 1, they would lose $2 * 10 = 20$ points (or gain -20 points). \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the game, players scores for each round are totaled and the player with the highest score wins. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "The gameplay for this game is quite complicated when players have multiple cards and there are a many nuanced plays that only players with good game sense and experience can see. However, the round with only one card is much easier to optimize because there are no game play considerations, only bidding. In this blog post, I will determine an optimal bidding strategy for the round with 1 card for different positions relative to the dealer. I will also show how this strategy changes when playing with a different number of players. "

    "Since every player wants to maximize their strategy, the optimal strategy in the first round clearly is to maximize the expected number of points a player will earn. Since there is only one trick, a player must decide between bidding 0 or 1. The payoff matrix is as follows: \n"

    "As we can see the payoff for betting 1 is higher than the payoff for betting 0. We still expect the optimal solution will try to be as accurate as possible, but it is likely betting 1 on edge cases is correct. Let p be the probability of winning, $E[bet = 1] = p * 30 + -10 * (1-p) = 40p - 10$ and  $E[bet = 0] = 20(1-p) + -10p = 20 - 30p$. So we bet 0 if $20 - 30p < 40p - 10$ and one otherwise. The decision boundary is given by $p = \\frac{3}{7}$\n",

    "If the dealer is dealt the 2 of a not-trump, the worst card we can have, the dealer will win if and only if no other players have a wizard, a trump card, or a higher card in the same suit as the 2. Lets calculate the probability of this happening. First, we assume the upcard is just a trump card, but we will get the same result if it's a Wizard. There are 12 + 4 + 12 = 28 cards that beat our led card, so we calculate the odds one of the other players have one of those cards. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability $p$ is given by $p = 1 - \\frac{58 - 28}{58} * \\frac{58 - 28}{57} * \\frac{58 - 28}{56} \\approx 0.854 = 85.4$% So our off-trump 2 is likley a loser, and we bet 0.\n",

    "We plot the dealer decision boundary below. If the dealer has the card shown or better, they should bid 1"
